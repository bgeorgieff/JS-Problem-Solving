Write a function that implements a calculator that has the following functionalities:
If the current Expression field (#expresisonOutput) contains the whole math expression (left operand, operator and right operand: Example: 9 + 2), the expected result should be the same.
When the equal sign "=" is pressed, the result of that expression should appear in the Result field (#resultOutput)
Otherwise, if we create an invalid expression such as "99 +" (without second/right operand) and we hit the equal sign "=", the expected result should be:
The "Clear" button should clear both Expression and Result fields (#expressionOutput and #resultOutput)
