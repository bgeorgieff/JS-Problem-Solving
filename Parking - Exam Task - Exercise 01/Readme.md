<b>Write a class Parking, which implements the following functionality:

**Functionality**
constructor ( capacity )  
Should have these 2 properties:
capacity – number;
vehicles – array;

Hint: You can add more properties to help you finish the task.  
addCar( carModel, carNumber )
The carModel and carNumber are of type string. 
If there's not enough parking spots for the car the park, throw an Error:
"Not enough parking space."

Otherwise this function should add the car, with the properties: carModel, carNumber, payed: default false, to the vehicles array and return:
"The {carModel}, with a registration number {carNumber}, parked."

**removeCar( carNumber )** 

If the car is not found, throw an Error:
"The car, you're looking for, is not found."
If the car hasn't payed, throw an Error:
"{carNumber} needs to pay before leaving the parking lot."

Otherwise, this function should remove the car from the vehicles array and return:
"{carNumber} left the parking lot."


**pay( carNumber )**  

If the car is not found, throw an Error:
"{carNumber} is not in the parking lot."
If the car has already payed, throw an Error:
"{carNumber}'s driver has already payed his ticket."

Otherwise, this function set payed to true on the found car and return:
"{carNumber}'s driver successfully payed for his stay."  

**getStatistics(carNumber)**  

This method can be called with one parameter or without any.  
If NO parameter is provided, the method should return the full information of the parking lot.  
At the first line:  
"The Parking Lot has { emptySlots } empty spots left."  
On the lines, display information about each vehicle, sorted alphabetically ascending by their carModel:  
"{carModel} == {carNumber} - {Has payed / Not payed}"  
If the method is called with parameter for carNumber:  
 return only the information about the car with the given carNumber:  
"{carModel} == {carNumber} - {Has payed / Not payed}"\  
  
**Sample code usage**  
const parking = new Parking(12);  
console.log(parking.addCar("Volvo t600", "TX3691CA"));  
console.log(parking.getStatistics());  
console.log(parking.pay("TX3691CA"));  
console.log(parking.removeCar("TX3691CA"));  
  
**Corresponding output**
  
The Volvo t600, with a registration number TX3691CA, parked.  
The Parking Lot has 11 empty spots left.  
Volvo t600 == TX3691CA - Not payed  
TX3691CA's driver successfully payed for his stay.  
TX3691CA left the parking lot.
